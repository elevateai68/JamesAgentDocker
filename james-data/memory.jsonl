This great cartoon was directed by Darrel Van Citters with production design by Michael Giamo. Box Office Bunny was released on 2/8/91. A \"Cineminium 100 Screen Multiplex Movie Theater\" is constructed right over Bugs Bunny's rabbit hole home.

The Reed & Barton Silversmiths division continues to produce a wide range of fine sterling silver, silver plated, and stainless steel tableware and gifts, including flatware, server ware, and hollowware, as well as picture frames, Christmas ornaments, baby gifts, and musicals.\nThe Reed & Barton Handcrafted Chests division is the world\u2019s largest maker of wooden jewelry boxes and flatware chests. In addition, it offers protective rolls and storage bags for flatware and hollowware, cigar humidors, and pen chests. The result of a 1990s acquisition, Miller Rogaska Crystal by Reed & Barton produces handcrafted crystal, including stemware, barware, and giftware. Another acquisition, the Sheffield Silver Company, forms the basis of Reed & Barton: The Sheffield Collection. This division concentrates on hollowware and silver plated tableware, offering products such as serving trays, wine coolers, candle ware, and napkin rings. The R&B Every Day division produces high-quality stainless steel flatware intended for everyday use.\nSterling\u00a0silver is 92.5% silver\u00a0with a 7.5% additive, usually copper. Sterling made in the USA after approximately the 1850's always has a sterling mark.\u00a0 It may say Sterling.\u00a0 It may be.925 or show the fraction 925/1000.\u00a0 If it does not have this mark then it is likely not sterling, unless it is foreign made (not in the USA) and has other hallmarks that designate its silver content. \u00a0 It can also be tested with an acid to determine its content.\u00a0 This should only be done by a professional.\nSterling flatware always retains it intrinsic silver value & usually a value also as tableware.\u00a0 Silver plate has no intrinsic silver value.\u00a0 It is not worth the refining costs to try to redeem the silver. It has very little resale value as tableware.\nSterling will last forever if you want to use it and take care of it.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n", "source_file": "Heritage Auction.docx"}
